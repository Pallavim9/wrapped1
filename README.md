# Wrapped1
Capital One Software Engineering Summit Hackathon 1st Place winner project

### About
Worked with 6 other summiteers at the 36 hour hackathon to produce Wrapped1, a first-place winning web application that uses data analytics and a user-friendly interface to promote financial literacy and budgeting-oriented conversations. Users can separate their spending into different categories to access category-specific breakdowns, as well as a monthly "wrapped" page, which features shareable insights into their spending and saving habits that month. 

### Using Wrapped1
To access Wrapped1, go to [https://wrapped1.herokuapp.com/](url). You should see a login page - just click sign in as there is no need to provide any information.
